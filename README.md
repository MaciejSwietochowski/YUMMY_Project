# SoYummy Project


## 📲 <a name="About projects">Project</a>

<p>What was the project like? It was a 7-day group work on an SoYummy application that resulted in a complete QA manual testing project.</p>
<p>Each day there were different tasks completed within the weekly sprint. Throughout the development of the test project, I was able to ask questions of the mentor.</p> 
<p>During the work I had the opportunity to learn how to use many tools such as Slack, Jira, Qase.</p>
